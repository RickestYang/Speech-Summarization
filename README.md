# Video Speech Summarization

This little project is to generate a speech summarization on a youtube video. It concatenate two distinct models, one for speech recognition, one for summarization. 

1. Converting a youtube video into aduio clips, then perform speech recognition on each clip and add all transcriptions into one.

2. Feed the transcription to summarization model, generate a summary on whole speech.

3. If running the app encouters a memory crash problem, make the value of variable *sec_per_split* in **_split_audio_** function smaller.
